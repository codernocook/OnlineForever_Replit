# Replit_JsForever
A Javascript file that make Replit online forever with kill 1 command.

You **also need a monitor** for this. You can check the **`#Monitor`** below.


# How to use?
1. Drag this file to your Replit project.
2. Add this
  ```javascript
  require("./jsForever.js")();
  ```
to the first line of your main javascript file.

If you put it in another folder just change the `./jsForever.js` to your file path

3. Done!

# Why it need the `kill 1` command?
Replit have a limitation, if it reached or over the limit. Your project won't work, but it's still online.
